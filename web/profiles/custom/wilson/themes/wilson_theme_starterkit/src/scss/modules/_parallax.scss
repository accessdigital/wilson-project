// background-attachment: fixed is problematic on iOS, so to create
// parallax style backgrounds with fixed backgrounds, we must apply
// the background attachment and then take it off again for devices
// that can't support it. Unfortunately there's no specific @supports
// for background attachment, so instead we use a test that represents
// a similar set of devices.
@layer components {
  .bg-parallax {
    background-attachment: fixed;
  }

  @supports (-webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch) {
    .bg-parallax {
      background-attachment: unset;
    }
  }
}
